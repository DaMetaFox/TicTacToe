# TicTacToe
 Sorry for my horrible english.
 
 > #translationByGoogle

 I did it myself with the rules of the typical tic tac toe it's all done in python and only the pygame and time library were used.
 
 The game isn't very elaborate because I do it more to solve mental problems than for aesthetics ... and I'm only 13 years old.
 
 
 #  To Play
 
To play it you just need to install the dependencies (pygame and time) and run the _game_loop.py file.
